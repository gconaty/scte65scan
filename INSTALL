LINUX OR WINDOWS
================
Run 'make'.

CROSS-COMPILING TO WINDOWS FROM LINUX
=====================================
Run 'CC=i386-mingw32-gcc make'

COMPILING WITH HDHOMERUN SUPPORT
================================
Get libhdhomerun_20090415.tgz from Silicon Dust
Untar in this directory creating ./libhdhomerun in the process.
Run 'make -f Makefile.hdhr'

Note: This has only been tested with v20090415 of libhdhomerun and firmware.
Silicon Dust has been known to arbitrarily change the API which may break
the ability to compile.

Note2: Some earlier versions of HDHomerun firmware did not understand
'qam256' as a modulation setting.  To see if this impacts you, run
'hdhomerun_config FFFFFFFF set /tuner0/channel qam256:57000000'.
If it complains about an invalid channel, you will need to use a different
initial tuning file with 'auto' as a modulation parameter.  This can be
done using the global search/replace function of your favorite editor or with 
'sed s/QAM256/auto/ us-Cable-Standard-center-frequencies-QAM256 > hdhr-itfile'
