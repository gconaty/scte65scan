INTRODUCTION
============
Comcast is in the process of transitioning analog TV to digital transmission.
In areas where this is happening, they are handing out free Digital To Analog
(DTA) boxes, typically a Pace DC50X, to allow those customers with analog
TV's to continue receiving their TV programming.  However, digital TV can bring
additional complications for the end-user.  Where a customer would typically
enter "29" on their remote control, the TV would tune to RF frequency number
29 (255Mhz) and the Discover Channel would appear.  With digital TV, there
can exist multiple stations at each RF frequency, so you end up with channels
having numbers such as "119.8".  To ease the end-user, Virtual Channel Tables
(VCT) are employed so that a user can continue to type "29" when he/she wants
to watch the Discover Channel.  The VCT tells the TV tune to RF channel
number 119 and pick out program 8, all invisible to the end-user.  Services
such as Schedules Direct, Zap2it, etc. also use the virtual channel number (VC)
when supplying guide data.  Traditionally, full fledged set top boxes (STB)
contained a POD interface, which is a special tuner that tunes frequencies
outside of the normal TV spectrum using a modulation not normally associated
with normal (in-band) TV standards (out-of-band or OOB transmission).
Normally, VCT's, guide data, encryption keys, etc. are sent to the STB using
the OOB channel.  However, DTA's are severely cost reduced such that they
do not contain a POD interface.  To get around this, Comcast is transmitting
the tables in-band in areas where they have deployed DTA's.  DTA's are also
incapable of encryption, so stations intended for them are sent "in the clear".

This program is intended to find and read these tables using supported hardware.
These tables appear to adhere to the ANSI/SCTE 65 standard.

FINDING THE TABLES
==================
Do:
	./scte65scan itfile > tables.txt

Where 'itfile' is 'us-Cable-Standard-center-frequencies-QAM256' or one
of your own choosing if not appropriate.  On Fedora machines, other initial
tuning files can be found at /usr/share/dvb-apps/atsc/ and on Ubuntu
machines at /usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples/scan/atsc.

If you think you can make it prettier from a spreadsheet, do:
	./scte65scan -f2 itfile > tables.csv

Cable providers typically transmit local Hi-Def broadcast stations in the clear.
However, DTA's are not capable of HD so these are not included in the tables.
Local broadcast stations instead use ATSC standard PSIP information.  Add '-p'
if you have HDTV and/or want scte65scan to also scan for PSIP VCT's.

FINDING WHICH TABLE IS YOURS
============================
Looking at the resulting tables, you'll probably notice that there is more than
one map.  You'll have to determine which one is correct and note the VCT_ID.
If you already have STB or DTA, you can bring up a diagnostic page that tells
which VCT_ID to use.  The Pace DC50X screen with the VCT_ID looks like this:
http://picasaweb.google.com/virgegx/ComcastDTAUnboxing#5276142959144255586

If you don't have that information, unfortunately there currently isn't any
way to get it automatically.  However, you can sometimes eliminate some maps
by inspection.  For example, if a map contains a station with callsign
"Shelbyville Public Access" and you don't live in Shelbyville, then that
map is probably not yours.  Similarly, if you have a map that has TBS
associated with VC 28 but you see a home shopping network at channel 28
on your analog TV or your TV guide, then that map is also probably not yours.

VERIFYING THE VCT_ID WITH MYTHTV
================================
NOTE: More updated documentation on usage with MythTV can probably be found
on the MythTV wiki.

First, back up the database using:
	msyqldump mythconverg > mythbackup.sql

Depending how your database is set up, you may need to add '-u user' and/or
'-p password' after 'msyqldump'.

If you mess up, you can restore using
	msyql mythconverg < mythbackup.sql

Depending how your database is set up, you may need to add '-u user' and/or
'-p password' after 'msyql'.

Do:
	./scte65scan -f3 > allchannels.sql
(add 'itfile' if the tuner isn't already tuned in)

If your clearQAM card/device isn't doesn't have sourceid=1, you can
specify the sourceid of the card by using the comma notation, e.g.:
	./scte65scan -f3,2 itfile > myth-svct.sql

if the sourceid of your card is 2.

Then do:
	csplit -b %02d.sql -f vct -z allchannels.sql "/^-- WARNING/" {*}

Except for vct00.sql, examine the top of each vct??.sql file for VCT_ID's
you have already determined to be inappropriate. Then do:
	mysql mythconverg < vct00.sql
	mysql mythconverg < vct01.sql

If you have already determined that vct01.sql is not an appropriate VCT_ID
then go onto the next one that may be (e.g. vct02.sql).

If you haven't already, configure your lineup and run mythfilldatabase.
From MythTV, start up LiveTV and surf the channels.  If the programming
matches what's displayed in the OSD, then you have the correct table.  Make
a note of the VCT_ID at the top of the vct??.sql file for future reference.

If the programming you are surfing doesn't match what's displayed in the OSD,
exit LiveTV, open an SSH session to your Mythbox, import the next vct??.sql
file (i.e. 'mythsql mythconverg < vct02.sql' if continuing the step above),
and start surfing again.  Repeat as necessary until you find a match.

VERIFYING THE VCT_ID WITH MPLAYER OR VLC
========================================
If you want to test which map is yours, do:
	./scte65scan -f1 -n1 itfile > allchannels.conf
(you can leave off 'itfile' if the tuner is already tuned in)

Then do:
	csplit -b %02d.conf -f channels -z allchannels.conf "/^#end/1" {*}

This creates a different channels.conf file for each map.  You can test-watch
a channel in the map by doing:
	mplayer dvb://'vc' -dvbin file=channels00.conf
or
	vlc channels.conf

where 'vc' is the virtual channel number you want to test (e.g. '2', '3', etc.)
If what you see looks like a station with the callsign/name associated with
the VC, then you have a match.

Repeat this for several VC's and all the channels??.conf files until you find
the correct file, then make a note of the VCT_ID at the top of that file.

NOTE: mplayer currrently has a bug where the '-dvbin file=...' option is
totally hosed.  Until they fix it, you'll have to do this instead:
	cp channels00.conf ~/.mplayer/channels.conf

IMPORTING A SPECIFIC VCT_ID INTO MYTHTV
=======================================
NOTE: More updated documentation on usage with MythTV can probably be found
on the MythTV wiki.

Do:
	./scte65scan -p -V your_VCT_ID -f3 itfile > myth-svct.sql

If your clearQAM card/device doesn't have sourceid=1, you can
specify the sourceid of the card by using the comma notation, e.g.:
	./scte65scan -p -V your_VCT_ID -f3,2 itfile > myth-svct.sql

if the sourceid of your card is 2.

Back up your database by doing:
	mysqldump mythconverg > mythbak.sql

Depending how your database is set up, you may need to add '-u user' and/or
'-p password' after 'msyqldump'

Look over myth-svct-sql and make sure everything looks right, then do:
	mysql mythconverg < myth-svct.sql

Again, you may need '-u user' and/or '-p password'

UPDATING MYTHTV WHEN THE VIRTUAL CHANNEL MAP CHANGES
====================================================
NOTE: More updated documentation on usage with MythTV can probably be found
on the MythTV wiki.

Cable providers are known to physically re-arrange channels from time
to time.  If the provider is using profile 2 of SCTE-65, there will be
a version number associated with each table and this number should change
when the table changes.  To update MythTV with these changes use:
	./scte65scan -p -V your_VCT_ID -f4,2 itfile > myth-svct.sql
	mysql [-u user -p password] mythconverg < myth-svct.sql
